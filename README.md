all of my work in the past, present, and future is to be forever dual-licensed under both [Unlicense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlicense)/[WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL) (the most permissive licenses with no conditions).

I have too many ideas to be able to do anything with them all, so I want to ensure anyone may use them as freely as possible and without conditions.
